### Integrate chatbot and web scraping logic:

Modify the send_message function in your GUI to process user input, decide whether to use the chatbot response or perform a Google search, and display the results accordingly.

### Enhance grammar and sentence structure:

To improve the grammar and sentence structure of bot responses, you can use libraries like `nltk` or `spaCy` for natural language processing. These libraries can help with tasks like sentence tokenization and grammatical correction.
